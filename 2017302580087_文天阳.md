## R15

(a) 110 - 90 = 20 (Byte)

(b) ack number = 90, It will be 90 since the first segment is lost.

## P40

(a) [1, 6] and [23, 26]

(b) [6, 16] and [17, 22]

(c) Three redundant acks

(d) timeout

(e) 32

(f) 42/2 = 21

(g) 29/2 = 14

(h) packet 70 is transmitted in the seventh transmission cycle

(i) ssthresh = 4ï¼Œcwnd = 4+3=7

(j) ssthread =  21, cwnd = 4

(k) 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 21 = 52packets


## P44

(a) Each RTT need one MSS, so 6 RTTS are needed

(b) 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 51 MSS
	  51mss / 6rtt = 8.5 MSS / RTT
